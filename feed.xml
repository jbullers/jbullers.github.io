Are getters and setters enough? An exploration of designing classes that reveal as little as possible.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 May 2016 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid>http://blogawesome.com/posts/2016-03-15-intersection-union-types</guid><link>http://blogawesome.com/posts/2016-03-15-intersection-union-types</link><title>Intersection and Union Types</title><description>Buckle up for a trip down the rabbit hole! What are &lt;em&gt;intersection types&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;union types&lt;/em&gt;, can we use them in Java, and why would we want to?</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Mar 2016 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid>http://blogawesome.com/posts/2016-02-17-inheritance-delegation</guid><link>http://blogawesome.com/posts/2016-02-17-inheritance-delegation</link><title>Inheritance and Delegation</title><description>We learn a lot about inheritance, and our languages often have constructs that lead us to using it as the solution to many modeling problems. But then we're also told we should prefer delegation to inheritance.

But there's a difference between defining value types and object types, and that difference bleeds over in to API design.</description><pubDate>Tue, 09 Feb 2016 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
