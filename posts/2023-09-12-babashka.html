    <p>A little while ago, I decided to add a bit of customization to my prompt. I use <a href="https://starship.rs/">Starship</a> because I like the look of it, and it's portable between my WSL environment and Powershell for when I need to work from the Windows terminal (not often for personal projects, but fairly often the case at work).</p><p>Out of the box, Starship supports quite a few languages and environments, and it will show version information when you're in a project directory. For example, if I'm in a Java project directory, it will show me the version of Java installed on my system:</p><p><img src="../img/starship-java.gif" alt="Starship prompt showing Java version" /></p><p>Here you can see that the prompt is reporting that I'm in a Java project directory and have Java version 17.0.7 installed. Actually, I'm in a Clojure project directory; by default, Starship treats directories containing <code>deps.edn</code> as an indicator to show the Java version.</p><p>While that's helpful, I figured it would be even better if I could also show the Clojure version of the project. I fiddled around for a while, and was finally able to come up with the following Starship configuration:</p><pre><code class="toml">[custom.clojure]
command = '''awk 'match($0, /clojure \{:mvn\/version "(.*)"\}\}/, a) { print a[1] }' deps.edn'''
detect_files = ['deps.edn']
symbol = 'Óù® '
format = 'and [$symbol($output)]($style) '
style = 'blue'
</code></pre><p>The interesting part is the command being executed, which essentially searches the project's <code>deps.edn</code> for <code>clojure {:mvn/version "&lt;something&gt;"}}</code> and extracts the <code>&lt;something&gt;</code>. For reference, the <code>deps.edn</code> may look something like this:</p><pre><code class="clojure">{:paths ["src"]

 :deps
 {org.clojure/clojure {:mvn/version "1.10.1"}
  ;; other dependencies
}
</code></pre><p>That gives me a nice prompt that looks like this:</p><p><img src="../img/starship-clojure.gif" alt="Starship prompt showing Java and Clojure versions" /></p><p>You can see that in addition to Java version 17.0.7, the prompt also tells us the project is using Clojure version 1.10.1. Mission accomplished, right?</p><p>Well, it turns out, you don't technically <em>have to</em> specify the Clojure version in your project's <code>deps.edn</code>. At a minimum, it will always be found in the base <code>deps.edn</code> that was installed with the CLI. Technically, there are <strong>three</strong> different <code>deps.edn</code> files in play that all get merged together, and the Clojure version could come from any of them.</p><p>What I'd need to do in order for the prompt to work properly in all circumstances is to check the project <code>deps.edn</code> for the version, and if it's not there, then check <code>~/.clojure/deps.edn</code>, and if it's not <em>there</em>, finally fall back to the CLI's <code>/usr/local/lib/clojure/deps.edn</code>. I had a hard enough time figuring out the <code>awk</code> command above, I had no idea how I'd run that command conditionally across multiple files.</p><p>But I didn't need to figure that out! I remembered reading about <a href="https://babashka.org/">Babashka</a> a while back, and my current problem was a perfect fit for their tagline: "Avoid switching between Clojure and bash scripts." I may not be that great at Clojure, but I'm significantly worse at bash, so why not give it a go?</p><p>Here's my script in all its glory:</p><pre><code class="clojure">#!/usr/bin/env bb

(require '[babashka.fs :as fs])

(defn parse-version [deps-edn]
  (get-in deps-edn [:deps 'org.clojure/clojure :mvn/version]))

(defn read-deps-edn [path]
  (and (fs/readable? path)
       (edn/read-string (slurp (str path)))))

(def clj-version (comp parse-version read-deps-edn))

(println (or (clj-version "./deps.edn")
             (clj-version (fs/expand-home "~/.clojure/deps.edn"))
             (clj-version "/usr/local/lib/clojure/deps.edn")))
</code></pre><p>First, I defined a <code>parse-version</code> function. Given a <code>deps.edn</code> map as input, it pulls out the Clojure version. Already, I'm reaping benefits: this is doing the same thing as the <code>awk</code> command, but now I'm working with a data structure instead of text, which is a lot more robust. I also find this infinitely more readable (subjective, of course).</p><p>Next, I defined a <code>read-deps-edn</code> function. Given a path, if the file at that path is readable, then read it in as EDN and produce a Clojure data structure, or <code>nil</code> if the file was not readable (e.g. it doesn't exist). There may be nicer ways to handle checking if there is indeed a project <code>deps.edn</code>, but this is what I came up with, and it works well enough.</p><p>I then compose these two functions to create the function <code>clj-version</code>: calling this function with a path produces the Clojure version in the <code>deps.edn</code> at that path, or <code>nil</code>.</p><p>Finally, I output the first Clojure version I find, in order of <code>deps.edn</code> precedence. Nice.</p><p>There might be a way to ask the <code>clojure</code> CLI to output the Clojure version it's using (and resolve the different <code>deps.edn</code> locations for me), which I could then just parse, but I couldn't figure out how to do it in any way that performed as well as just parsing the files myself. In any case, I think the above solution is still much nicer than messing around with text directly, and it was a fun little introduction to Babashka.</p>
